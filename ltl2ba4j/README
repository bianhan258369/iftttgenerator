LTL2BA4J is a Java 5 interface for the LTL to Büchi automaton conversion tool ltl2ba.

Usage:
Use the static methods provided in rwth.i2.ltl2ba4j.LTL2BA4J in order to perform the conversion.
You can either enter formulas as String or as objects (see package "formula").
The returned state machine can be customized by setting another graph factory (see package "model").
The classes concerning the Java Native Interface are all situated in the package "internal".
You should normally not be required to do any changes here.

LTL2BA4J comes with precompiled instances of ltl2ba for Windows and Linux.
To make it work on another OS, compile everything in c-src (you may use the Makefile) and make the library available to the JRE setting java.library.path.
